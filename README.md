# Higher-order-interactions

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is a Matlab program designed for calculating the benefit-to-cost ratio of any higher-order networks.

--f_cal_remeet_time_two: function to calculate two-dimensional coalescence time for any network.

--f_cal_remeet_time_three: function to calculate three-dimensional coalescence time for any network.

--f_cal_remeet_time_four: function to calculate four-dimensional coalescence time for any network.

--f_get_bcratio_accumulate: function to calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of any higher-order networks based on the accumulated payoff.

--f_get_bcratio_average_type1: function to calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of any higher-order networks based on the uncoupled average payoff.

--f_get_bcratio_average_type2: function to calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of any higher-order networks based on the coupled average payoff.

Three examples are provided to show how to calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of a given higher-order network based on the accumulated payoff:

--Main_higher_order_star.m: calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of higher-order star networks.

--Main_conjoin_well_mixed.m: calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of conjoined complete networks.

--Main_conjoin_rich_club.m: calculate the critical benefit-to-cost ratio of conjoined rich club networks.
